        <p id=intro>Hello world!
          I'm a student creative currently seasonaly based out of Boston and Seattle. I am currently in progress of getting my BFA in UX/UI Design at Lesley University, in Cambridge. <br> I enjoy exploring interface, creating editorial work, and taking photos of all different kinds.<br> Outside of school I enjoy throwing myself into a multitude of hobbies, from climbing plastic rocks, falling face-first into snow, watching cars go in circles, and ruining my ear drums.<br> (ie rock climbing, snowboarding, motorsports, and concerts)</p>

          I enjoy exploring all facets of design! I'm still learning, and want to explore all that I can before I pick a favorite anything.
        </p>
        <h3>But for now, heres a few of my favorite typefaces, IN ORDER!</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Futura Condenced ExtraBold - anytime I use this typeface my friend tells me that it looks like a Nike ad. And maybe it does. But maybe that means there is a Nike position in my future</li>
          <li>Helvetica - The perfect all rounder. Simple? Maybe. But my biggest lesson this semester has been that less can be more. </li>
          <li>Anything Blackletter - Althought its a hard typeface group to make work due to its compexity, blackletter done right is heaven for my eyes. (thanks fontaines dc.) </li>
        </ol>
